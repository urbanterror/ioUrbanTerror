ioUrbanTerror is not a Frozen Sand product. It's a 3rd party product.

The ioUrbanTerror installer does not install Urban Terror. It only installs a free executable, called ioUrbanTerror.exe and BattlEye. It can be used instead of Quake 3 Arena to start Urban Terror 4.x. The actual Urban Terror files are available separately.

If you already own a full copy of Quake 3 Arena and want to continue using Punkbuster, you don't need ioUrbanTerror and can install/use Quake 3 Arena + Urban Terror. If you don't have Quake 3 Arena and/or don't care about Punkbuster, then you should use ioUrbanTerror. Don't forget to install Urban Terror 4.x after installing ioUrbanTerror.

A word of thanks to:
-The ioquake3 team, for providing a very good code base to work on.
-Hobbes, for helping me out a lot with creating this software.
-Illogical, for providing a very good looking logo.
-Frozen Sand, for creating Urban Terror and all the fun that comes with it.
-Bastian "$able" Suter, for adding BattlEye support.
