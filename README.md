ioUrbanTerror is an ioq3 based engine adapted to run Urban Terror by woekele.

It's source code is originally availabel at: http://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/games/urbanterror/iourbanterror/source

> The ioUrbanTerror installer does not install Urban Terror. It only installs a free executable, called ioUrbanTerror.exe and BattlEye. It can be used instead of Quake 3 Arena to start Urban Terror 4.x. The actual Urban Terror files are available separately.
> 
> If you already own a full copy of Quake 3 Arena and want to continue using Punkbuster, you don't need ioUrbanTerror and can install/use Quake 3 Arena + Urban Terror. If you don't have Quake 3 Arena and/or don't care about Punkbuster, then you should use ioUrbanTerror. Don't forget to install Urban Terror 4.x after installing ioUrbanTerror.
