# ioUrbanTerror

**ioUrbanTerror** is an [ioquake3](<https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3>) based engine adapted to run **Urban Terror**.

Created by _**woekele**_, ioUrT allows us to play **Urban Terror** standalone, i.e. without needing **Quake 3 Arena**.

It was the engine distributed with the 4.0 and 4.1 game files.

Please find [here](<https://github.com/urbanterror/ioUrbanTerror/blob/main/docs/ioUrbanTerror_README.txt>) its original README file.

The ioUrT source code and releases can still be found on the [University of Utwente's FTP](<http://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/games/urbanterror/iourbanterror/>).
